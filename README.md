# Java-StudentGen-Assessment

What did you like about this project?

I liked that it brought together all the concepts that we had learnt in class connecting the different concepts like abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance in a nice little package. I also liked that it showed us how practical OOP is in a real life situation.

What did you struggle with in this project?

I struggled with linking the different classes together in a coherent manner and also took some time to understand the codes that had already been provided. I would also probably struggle with coming up with the started codes by myself.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?

I think the time allocated was sufficient and that the examples we gone through in class was relevant. I would like if Jean is able to walk us through a little more about the thought process behind how we come up with classes in Java. But all in all, she is a great instructor and I learnt alot from her.
